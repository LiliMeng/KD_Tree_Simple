# KD_Tree_Simple

 Perform constructing trees, efficient exact query for k-nearest neighbors and 
 Best-Bin-First(BBF) query for approximate k-nearest neighbors search.
 For more BBF query, please refer to
 Beis, J. S. and Lowe, D. G.  Shape indexing using approximate nearest-neighbor search in high-dimensional spaces.
 
 

 
 Running Method: 
 Put all files( data files, .h file, and .cpp file)in one folder and run the .cpp file

Welcome to run the following .cpp files 


KNNKDTreeUnitTest.cpp      Test CreateKDTree, ExactKNearestNeighbor and ApproximateKNearestNeighbor

LoadPointsBuildSaveTree.cpp  The required application 1: Load points from a simple text file, build a KD Tree and save the KD Tree to disk

kNNSearch.cpp     Read a simple text fle and reports the top 3 nearest neighbors using both exact search and BBF approximate search


PrintAllDataID.cpp            Print out all data ID from a simple text file

BBFRecallAtOne.cpp    Cannot use right now!!! The Recall of BBF Approximate Search at 1 nearest neighbor for 10 query points from a dataset of 1000 points
