# KD_Tree_Simple

A slimmed version of KD tree for k Nearest Neighbor search 

 Perform constructing trees, efficient exact query for k-nearest neighbors based on Bounded priority queue kd-tree,
 Best-Bin-First(BBF) query for approximate k-nearest neighbors search.
 For more BBF query, please refer to
 Beis, J. S. and Lowe, D. G.  Shape indexing using approximate nearest-neighbor search in high-dimensional spaces.
 
 
 Running Method: 
 Put data files, .h file, and .cpp file in one folder and run the .cpp file
